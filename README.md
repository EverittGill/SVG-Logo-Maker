# SVT Logo Maker

## Description

This is a CLI program using Inquirer to prompt users for some simple criteria for an even simpler SVG image that can be used as a yet even simpler logo. It accepts some text up to three characters, a shape of the image, color of the image, and color of the text. From the user responses it will generate an SVG file titled "logo.svg"

- I was motivated to create this project because I've been asked many times to do graphic design for people in exchange for nothing. Now I can tell them to go use my custom logo maker and I don't have any second thoughts about helping these people who don't know how to make their own images. 
- This program allows users to make a very simple logo extremely quickly, which for many cases is probably sufficient. 
- From building this program I learned that modularization is actually important and why it isn't the best practice to keep all your JS on the same file. 
- I learned that it isn't very difficult to generate a simple svg file.
- I learned that actually writing code for only 3-4 hours per day is optimal for me right now and that any more has quickly diminishing returns.
